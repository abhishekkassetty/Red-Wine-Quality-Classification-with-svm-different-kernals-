mini project on svm

Prediction the quality of wine

Collected Data from UCI Machine Learning repository .

              https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

Preprocessed the data and visualised the data with the help of python libraries.

Trained the data with different kernels of SVM algorithm and did the analysis of different kernels .
              
              1.Linear kernal
              2.Polynomial kernal
              3.RBF(radial basis function) kernal
              4.sigmoid kernal
